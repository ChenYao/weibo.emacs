This is a Weibo client for EMACS.

Initialization:

1. Put .el files into a directory.

2. Make sure that directory is part of "load-path":
    (add-to-list 'load-path "path to directory")

Usage:

1. Please make sure you have GNUTLS (or OPENSSL) installed and
   functionaly:
   - You should either have gnutls-cli or openssl in your PATH
   - Or if you are using Emacs 24, you can also use the built-in GNUTLS
     support if enabled

2. Load the weibo library:
     (require 'weibo)

3. Authorization:
   - The first time you use the client(e.g., check the time line) or
     if your token expired, you will be redirected to the Sina
     authorization page, where you can authorize this client and see a
     pin number.
   - Input that pin number into the echo area in EMACS
    
4. Check your timeline:
     M-x weibo-timeline
